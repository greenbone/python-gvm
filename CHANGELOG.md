All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0] - 2020-06-10

### Added

* Extend AliveTest and ScannerType enums.
  [#235](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/235)

### Fixed

* Fix python-gvm v8/v9 type checks. [#244](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/244)

[1.6.0]: https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0

## [1.5.0] - 2020-05-12

### Added

* Add full support for audits and policies. Add `get_policy`, `get_policies`,
  `clone_policy`, `delete_policy`, `get_audit`, `get_audits`, `clone_audit` and
  `delete_audit` methods to GMPv9 class. Also do not return policies for config
  requests and audits for task requests [#223](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/223)

### Changed

* If it isn't possible to connect to a Unix Domain Socket a GvmError is raised
  now [#207](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/207)

### Removed

* Dropped version handling code from python-gvm and replaced it with using
  pontos.version [#213](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/213)

[1.5.0]: https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/compare/v1.4.0...v1.5.0

## [1.4.0]

### Added
* Added an API and CLI utilities for the version handling in python-gvm
  [#198](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/198)

### Changed
* Replaced `pipenv` with `poetry` for dependency management. `poetry install`
  works a bit different then `pipenv install`. It installs dev packages by
  default and also python-gvm in editable mode. This means after running
  `poetry install` gvm will directly be importable in the virtual python
  environment. [#197](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/197)
* Update error classes to always have meaningful `__str__` and `__repr__`
  method. This allows for easier error printing
  [#199](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/199)

[1.4.0]: https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/compare/v1.3.0...v1.4.0

## [1.3.0]

### Added
* Added `GvmServerError`, `GvmClientError`, `GvmResponseError` and `InvalidArgumentType` error type classes [#192](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/192)

### Changed
* Refactored the `InvalidArgument` and `RequiredArgument` errors in the gmp classes [#192](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/192)
* Refactored the status response errors in case of a failure in the communication with the server in `transform.py` [#192](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/192)

[1.3.0]: https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/compare/v1.2.0...v1.3.0

  `gmp.protocols.gmp` module [#186](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/186)

### Fixed
* Added a workaround that fixes the `exclude_hosts`-bug in the method `modify_target`.
  See [#187](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/issues/187) for more details [#188](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/188)
* Fixed value of `EntityType.AGENT` enum [#190](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pull/190)

[1.0.0.beta3]: https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/compare/v1.0.0.beta2...v1.0.0.beta3

## [1.0.0.beta2] - 2018-12-04

### Added
* Added new `trigger_alert` method for triggering an alert method on a
  specific report.
* Added `import_config` method to import a scan config from xml.
* Added helper function to validate xml input `gvm.xml.validate_xml_string`
* Add `finish_send` method to connections. The method allows to indicate to
  the server sending data is finished and no additional data has to be received.

### Changed
* `help` method `type` argument got renamed to `help_type`
* `help` method `help_type` argument will be checked for invalid values
* `create_credential` requires a credential_type argument now.
* Optional arguments are required to be passed as keyword arguments.
* `get_report` method `format_id` argument got renamed to
  `report_format_id`
* Check if scanner_type is one of '1' (OSP Scanner) or '2' (OpenVAS Scanner) in
  `create_scanner` method.

  method_data dict parameters of `create_alert` method.
* Fixed `get_reports` sending the wrong protocol command

* Fixed `get_config` sending the correct protocol command.
* Don't crash if huge content is returned in a xml response. This fixes e.g.
  `get_reports` for bigger report data.

### Removed
* Removed `format_id` argument from get_reports
* Removed `alert_id` argument from `get_reports`
* Removed unused `read_timeout` argument from `UnixSocketConnection`

## [1.0.0.beta1] - 2018-11-13

python-gvm was a part of [gvm-tools](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools)
prior gvm-tools version 2.0. It got extracted from gvm-tools and completely
overhauled.

Some notable changes are:

* The package name changed from *gmp* to *gvm*.
* The type of connection is passed to a more generic Gmp class instead of
  having to select the connection when creating the gmp object.
* Support for different protocols and versions has been added. Currently
  supported protocols are OSP v1 and GMP v7.
* Full API documentation is available at https://python-gvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
* Possible arguments to protocol methods are documented.
* Arguments should be passed as keywords

### Gmp API changes

* `create_report` has been renamed to `import_report`.
* Requesting single entities has been extracted from the list commands e.g.
  `get_task(task_id)` instead of `get_tasks(task_id=task_id)`.
* `get_info` requests a single info entity.
* `get_info_list` requests a list of info entities.
* `filt_id` argument is called `filter_id` at all Gmp methods.
* `report_filter` argument for `get_reports` got renamed to `filter`.
  `report_filt_id` is `filter_id` now.
* `create_schedule` `start_time` and `end_time` arguments got split into
  several parameters.
* Plural arguments like `hosts`, `users`, ... always require a list now.
* `create_alert` `event`, `condition` and `method` arguments got
  revised and split.
* Boolean parameters expect True and False and not 1, 0, '1' or '0' now.
* `get_assets` type parameter got renamed to `asset_type`
* Copying an entity via the `copy` argument has been removed and extracted to
  own `clone` methods e.g. `clone_task`.
