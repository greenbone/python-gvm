The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Python API library (**python-gvm**) is a
collection of APIs that help with remote controlling a Greenbone Security
Manager (GSM) appliance and its underlying Greenbone Vulnerability Manager
(GVM). The library essentially abstracts accessing the communication protocols
Greenbone Management Protocol (GMP) and Open Scanner Protocol (OSP).

## Documentation

The documentation for python-gvm can be found at
[https://python-gvm.readthedocs.io/](https://python-gvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Please always take a look at the documentation for further details. This
**README** just gives you a short overview.

## Installation

### Version

Please consider to always use the **newest** version of `gvm-tools` and `python-gvm`.
We freqently update this projects to add features and keep them free from bugs.
This is why installing `python-gvm` using pip is recommended.

The current release of `python-gvm` can be used with all supported GOS versions.

### Requirements

Python 3.5 and later is supported.

### Install using pip

pip 19.0 or later is required.

You can install the latest stable release of python-gvm from the Python Package
Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

    python3 -m pip install --user python-gvm

## Example

```python3
from gvm.connections import UnixSocketConnection
from gvm.protocols.gmp import Gmp
from gvm.transforms import EtreeTransform
from gvm.xml import pretty_print

connection = UnixSocketConnection()
transform = EtreeTransform()

with Gmp(connection, transform=transform) as gmp:
    # Retrieve GMP version supported by the remote daemon
    version = gmp.get_version()

    # Prints the XML in beautiful form
    pretty_print(version)

    # Login
    gmp.authenticate('foo', 'bar')

    # Retrieve all tasks
    tasks = gmp.get_tasks()

    # Get names of tasks
    task_names = tasks.xpath('task/name/text()')
    pretty_print(task_names)
```

## Support

For any question on the usage of python-gvm please use the
[Greenbone Community Portal](https://community.greenbone.net/c/gmp). If you
found a problem with the software, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools/issues)
on GitHub.

This project is maintained by [Greenbone Networks GmbH](https://www.greenbone.net/).

## Contributing

Your contributions are highly appreciated. Please
[create a pull request](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pulls) on GitHub.
For bigger changes, please discuss it first in the
[issues](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/issues).

For development you should use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
to keep you python packages separated in different environments. First install
poetry via pip

    python3 -m pip install --user poetry

Afterwards run

    poetry install

in the checkout directory of python-gvm (the directory containing the
`pyproject.toml` file) to install all dependencies including the packages only
required for development.

The python-gvm repository uses [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks)
to apply linting and auto formatting via git hooks. Please ensure the git hooks
are active.

    $ poetry install
    $ poetry run autohooks activate --force
