The Greenbone Vulnerability Management Python API library (**python-gvm**) is a
collection of APIs that help with remote controlling Greenbone Community Edition
installations and Greenbone Enterprise Appliances. The library essentially
abstracts accessing the communication protocols Greenbone Management Protocol
(GMP) and Open Scanner Protocol (OSP).

## Documentation

The documentation for python-gvm can be found at
[https://greenbone.github.io/python-gvm/](https://greenbone.github.io/python-gvm/).
Please always take a look at the documentation for further details. This
**README** just gives you a short overview.

## Installation

### Version

Please consider to always use the **newest** version of `gvm-tools` and `python-gvm`.
We frequently update this projects to add features and keep them free from bugs.
This is why installing `python-gvm` using pip is recommended.

**To use `python-gvm` with an old GMP version (7, 8, 9) you must use a release version**
**that is `<21.05`. In the `21.05` release the support of these versions have been dropped.**

### Requirements

Python 3.9 and later is supported.

### Install using pip

pip 19.0 or later is required.

You can install the latest stable release of python-gvm from the Python Package
Index using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/):

    python3 -m pip install --user python-gvm

## Example

```python3
from gvm.connections import UnixSocketConnection
from gvm.protocols.gmp import Gmp
from gvm.transforms import EtreeTransform
from gvm.xml import pretty_print

connection = UnixSocketConnection()
transform = EtreeTransform()

with Gmp(connection, transform=transform) as gmp:
    # Retrieve GMP version supported by the remote daemon
    version = gmp.get_version()

    # Prints the XML in beautiful form
    pretty_print(version)

    # Login
    gmp.authenticate('foo', 'bar')

    # Retrieve all tasks
    tasks = gmp.get_tasks()

    # Get names of tasks
    task_names = tasks.xpath('task/name/text()')
    pretty_print(task_names)
```

## Support

For any question on the usage of python-gvm please use the
[Greenbone Community Portal](https://community.greenbone.net/c/gmp). If you
found a problem with the software, please
[create an issue](https://github.com/greenbone/gvm-tools/issues)
on GitHub.

## Maintainer

This project is maintained by [Greenbone AG](https://www.greenbone.net/).

## Contributing

Your contributions are highly appreciated. Please
[create a pull request](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/pulls) on GitHub.
For bigger changes, please discuss it first in the
[issues](https://github.com/greenbone/python-gvm/issues).

For development you should use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org)
to keep you python packages separated in different environments. First install
poetry via pip

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user poetry
```

Afterwards run

```shell
poetry install
```

in the checkout directory of python-gvm (the directory containing the
`pyproject.toml` file) to install all dependencies including the packages only
required for development.

The python-gvm repository uses [autohooks](https://github.com/greenbone/autohooks)
to apply linting and auto formatting via git hooks. Please ensure the git hooks
are active.

    $ poetry install
    $ poetry run autohooks activate --force
