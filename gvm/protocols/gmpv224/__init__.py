    This class implements the `Greenbone Management Protocol version 22.04`_

    Arguments:
        connection: Connection to use to talk with the gvmd daemon. See
            :mod:`gvm.connections` for possible connection types.
        transform: Optional transform `callable`_ to convert response data.
            After each request the callable gets passed the plain response data
            which can be used to check the data and/or conversion into different
            representations like a xml dom.

            See :mod:`gvm.transforms` for existing transforms.
